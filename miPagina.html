        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hey there! My name is <strong>Cristian Quesada Cossio</strong>
        I like to learn algorithms, programming and maths. <br>
        In my free time I use to play basketball with some friends.</p>
        Learning languages is a good way to create oppotunities around the word and make new friends,
        that's why I like to learn <mark>English</mark> and <mark>German</mark>.
